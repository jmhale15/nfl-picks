- Click "Baltimore" if you think they'll lose by 3 or fewer (or win)

**Over/Under Pick:** Click if you think the total points will be over or under
- Example: "Total: 47.5"
- Click "Over 47.5" if you think both teams will score 48+ total points
- Click "Under 47.5" if you think they'll score 47 or fewer total points

### Step 4: Save Your Picks
Click the blue "Save My Picks" button when you're done.

You'll see a green success message confirming your picks were saved.

A: Yes! Just go back to the website and make new picks, then click "Save" again. Your latest picks will overwrite the old ones.

**Q: What if the website is down?**
